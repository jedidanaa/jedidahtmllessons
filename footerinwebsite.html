        <h1>HUNTR/X</h1>
        <p>HUNTRIX is a fictional three-member K-pop girl group from the 2025 animated film KPop Demon Hunters, produced by Netflix
        and Sony Pictures Animation. In the story, they’re more than just global music sensations—behind the dazzling
        performances and sold-out stadium tours, they secretly battle supernatural threats. Using a mix of music, dance, and
        mystical powers, HUNTRIX fights against the Gwi-ma, soul-eating demons that endanger humanity. Their characters blend
        the glamour of K-pop with the thrill of fantasy action, making them a unique fusion of idol culture and heroic
        storytelling.</p>
